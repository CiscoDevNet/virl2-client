# VIRL 2 Client Library

## Introduction

This is the client library for the Cisco VIRL 2 Network Simulation Platform
(`virl2_client`). It provides a Python package to programmatically create,
edit, delete and control network simulations on a VIRL 2 controller.

It is a pure Python implementation that requires Python3. We've tested and
written the package with Python 3.6.8.

The **status** of this package can be considered **Beta**. We're not aware of
any major issues at the time of release. However, since this is the first
release of the package, bugs might exist. Both in the package as well as in
the API implementation on the controller.

## Use Case Description

The client library provides a convenient interface to control the lifecycle of
a network simulation. This can be used for automation scripts directly in
Python but also for third party integrations / plugins which need to integrate
with a simulated network. Examples already existing are an [Ansible
plugin](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-virl).

## Installation

The package comes in form of a wheel that is downloadable from the VIRL 2
controller. The package can be installed either from PyPi using

    pip3 install virl2_client

or, alternatively, the version that is bundled with the VIRL 2 controller can
be downloaded to the local filesystem and then directly installed via

    pip3 install ./virl2_client-*.whl

The bundled version is available on the index site of the docs when viewed
directly on the VIRL 2 controller.

Ensure to replace use the correct file name, replacing the wildcard with the
proper version/build information. For example

    pip3 install virl2_client-2.0.0b10-py3-none-any.whl

We recommend the use of a virtual environment for installation.

## Usage

The package itself is fairly well documented using docstrings. In addition, the
documentation is available in HTML format on the controller itself, via the
"Tools -> Client Library" menu.

## Compatibility

This package and the used API is specific to VIRL 2. It is not
backwards compatible with VIRL 1.x and therefore can not be used with VIRL
1.x. If you are looking for a convenient tool to interface with the VIRL 1 API
then the [VIRL Utils tool](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/virlutils) is
recommended.

## Known Issues

There are no known issues at this point. See the comment in the *Introduction*
section.
